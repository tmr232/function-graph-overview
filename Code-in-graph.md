# Code In Graph

## Proof of Concept

- [x] Ensure that changing node sizes does not entirely mess up the graphs
- [x] Highlight chunks of code using a syntax-highlighting library (these can be random pieces of code!)
- [x] Overlay chunks of code onto the graph

Once we are done with that, we'll need to do a ton of changes to actually implement this as a feature...

## Actual Implementation

- [ ] Collect code per-node
- [ ] Use rendered code proportions for graph node sizes
- [ ] Position code on the graph in a robust way
- [ ] Try to get the rendered code directly from the IDE, to maintain same style (low priority)
