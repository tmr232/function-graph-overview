# Code In Graph

## Proof of Concept

- [x] Ensure that changing node sizes does not entirely mess up the graphs
- [x] Highlight chunks of code using a syntax-highlighting library (these can be random pieces of code!)
- [x] Overlay chunks of code onto the graph

Once we are done with that, we'll need to do a ton of changes to actually implement this as a feature...
